Repository of Aileen Huang's Software Development Projects

**Hi! It's Aileen here!**

I’m a junior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in AI, where I specialize in designing innovative algorithms and transforming them into software solutions. This repository features a collection of my academic and personal projects, showcasing:

- **Backend Development Projects** – Server-side applications and APIs designed for scalability  
- **Data Structure & OOP Projects** – Coursework and practice implementations emphasizing clean architecture and algorithmic efficiency with Java  
- **ML_Driven_Applications** – Machine learning experiments and prototypes that explore predictive modeling and data-driven insights  
- **OCaml Development Projects** – Functional programming exercises and systems demonstrating my ability to tackle complex problems with OCaml  
- **Python Development Projects** – Coursework and practice implementations emphasizing clean architecture and algorithmic efficiency with Python  

You’ll also find more information on my work with Autoboat and Application Development Projects!

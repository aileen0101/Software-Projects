Challenges Attempted: (Tier I, Tier II, Tier III)

Difficulties: I think setting up and working with Postman 
for the first time was the most difficult part. 
Comments:
This assignment really helped me better understand the
 demo and the concept of routes in general! The demo
 was really useful in helping me navigate this assignment as well!
 I think it would be helpful to maybe explain
the libraries and functions we should be using beforehand 
so it's easier to understand which functions to use without always
referencing the demo.
